# opencv-with-python
In this repository, I will be pushing some of the python projects using openCV.
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) was build to generalize the infrastructure for the applications of computer vision.
Here, we will be performing some of the basic implementation of this module.

We will be covering the following topics:
  1.  Basics of OpenCV
      a.  Accessing the resources
      b.  Viewing and Saving Images and Videos
  2.  Manipulating the values of Image Pixels
      a.  Drawing text, circles, rectangles and other shapes in the images
      b.  Image and Video Size manipulation
      c.  Color Spaces
  3.  Getting acquianted with some of the useful methods of OpenCV libraries
      a.  Blurring Techniques
      b.  Edge Detection
      c.  Image Dilation
      d.  Image Transformations
      e.  Eroding Image
